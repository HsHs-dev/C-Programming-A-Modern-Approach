4. Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the
loop bodies are the same)?
(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) …
(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) …
(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) …
*/

/*
C is not equivalent to the other two loops, because the incrementing happens
before entering the loop body.
