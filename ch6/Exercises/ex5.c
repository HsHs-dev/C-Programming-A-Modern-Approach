Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the
loop bodies are the same)?
(a) while (i < 10) {…}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {…}
(c) do {…} while (i < 10);

/*
C is not equivalent to the other two loops, because the loop body is executed at least once even
if the condition is not met.
