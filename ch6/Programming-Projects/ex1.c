/*
1. Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. The program must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a negative number, the program must display the largest nonnegative number entered:
Enter a number: 60
Enter a number: 38.3
Enter a number: 4.89
Enter a number: 100.62
Enter a number: 75.2295
Enter a number: 0
The largest number entered was 100.62
Notice that the numbers arenâ€™t necessarily integers.
