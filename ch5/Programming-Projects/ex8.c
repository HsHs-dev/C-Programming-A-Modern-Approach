8. The following table shows the daily flights from one city to another:
Departure time   Arrival time
8:00 a.m.         10:16 a.m.
9:43 a.m.         11:52 a.m.
11:19 a.m.        1:31 p.m.
12:47 p.m.        3:00 p.m.
2:00 p.m.         4:08 p.m.
3:45 p.m.         5:55 p.m.
7:00 p.m.         9:20 p.m.
9:45 p.m.         11:58 p.m.
Write a program that asks user to enter a time (expressed in hours and minutes, using the 24-
hour clock). The program then displays the departure and arrival times for the flight whose
departure time is closest to that entered by the user:
Enter a 24-hour time: 13:15
Closest departure time is 12:47 p.m., arriving at 3:00 p.m.
Hint: Convert the input into a time expressed in minutes since midnight, and compare it to
the departure times, also expressed in minutes since midnight. For example, 13:15 is 13 Ã—
60 + 15 = 795 minutes since midnight, which is closer to 12:47 p.m. (767 minutes since
midnight) than to any of the other departure times.
