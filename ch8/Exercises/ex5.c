5. The Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦, where each number is the sum of the
two preceding numbers. Write a program fragment that declares an array named
fib_numbers of length 40 and fills the array with the first 40 Fibonacci numbers. Hint:
Fill in the first two numbers individually, then use a loop to compute the remaining numbers.
